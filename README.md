# Behind the strings

### Project theme
Create a web product that target and help with a specific goal on a local or global scale.\
(regarding [UN's 17 sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals))

### My solution: Behind the strings
This is my solution targeting a goal [#12 Responsible consumption and production](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12).\
This web product takes an url for a fashion item on any online store and show how sustainable the item is by analyzing what material used to produce the item. So it helps users to make a conscious decision whether purchase the item or not.
